    "\n",
    "A rotated sorted array is a sorted array that has been \"rotated\" at some pivot. For example:\n",
    "- Original sorted array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`\n",
    "- Rotated sorted array: `[4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3]`\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to search for a target value in a rotated sorted array. If the target exists, return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must solve this in \\(O(log n)\\) time, which suggests using **binary search**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Statment\n",
    "Write a function `search(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int` that takes:\n",
    "- `nums`: a list of integers representing the rotated sorted array.\n",
    "- `target`: the integer to search for.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",

    "Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0\n",

    "   - Right half: `[0, 1, 2]`\n",
