    "A **tree** is like a family tree:\n",
    "- It has a **root** (like the grandparent at the top).\n",
    "- Each **node** (person) can have \"children\" (connections to other nodes).\n",
    "- There's no going \"up and around\" (no cycles). It's a one-way street!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key parts:**\n",
    "- **Root**: The topmost node.\n",
    "- **Parent/Child**: Parent points to one or more children.\n",
    "- **Leaf**: A node with no children.\n",
    "- **Depth/Height**: Depth is \"how far down\" a node is; height is \"how tall\" the tree is from a specific node.\n",

    "## What is a Binary Tree? ü§î\n",
    "A **binary tree** is a type of tree where:\n",
    "- Each node has **at most two children**, referred to as the **left child** and **right child**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as a family tree where every person can have up to two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of a Binary Tree\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  2   3\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `1` is the **root** (the topmost node).\n",
    "- `2` and `3` are its children: `root.left` and `root.right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Tree Node Representation in Code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.left = None\n",
    "        self.right = None\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "root = TreeNode(1)\n",
    "root.left = TreeNode(2)\n",
    "root.right = TreeNode(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Root Node**: The topmost node in the tree. In the example, `1` is the root.\n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes**: Nodes with no children (both `left` and `right` are `None`).\n",
    "- **Parent Node**: The node directly above a given node. For example, `1` is the parent of `2` and `3`.\n",
    "- **Subtree**: Any node and its descendants can be considered a subtree. For instance, node `2` forms a subtree with `4` and `5`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trees Are Graphs\n",
    "- Binary trees are a subset of **directed graphs**.\n",
    "- Typically, you cannot traverse \"up\" the tree because nodes don‚Äôt have a `parent` reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Binary Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Complete Binary Tree**\n",
    "A tree where all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of a Complete Binary Tree:\n",
    "```\n",
    "          1\n",
    "        /   \\\n",
    "       2     3\n",
    "      / \\   / \n",
    "     4   5 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Node `3` has no right child, but the tree is still considered **complete**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Perfect Binary Tree**\n",
    "A tree where all levels are fully filled, and all leaf nodes are at the same depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of a Perfect Binary Tree:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  2   3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Trees as Arrays\n",
    "Binary trees can also be represented as arrays. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The array indices represent:\n",
    "- `i`: Current node.\n",
    "- `2*i + 1`: Left child.\n",
    "- `2*i + 2`: Right child.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tree Height (Depth)\n",
    "The **height** (or depth) of a binary tree is the number of edges from the root to the deepest leaf node.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  2   5\n",
    " /\n",
    "3\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Height = 3 (edges: `1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tree Traversals\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary trees are commonly used for **traversal**. There are two primary types:\n",
    "1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far down one branch as possible before backtracking.\n",
    "2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "DFS uses a **stack** (or recursion) to prioritize depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DFS Traversal Orders\n",
    "- **Pre-order**: Visit the root ‚Üí left ‚Üí right.\n",
    "  - Example: `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 10]`\n",
    "- **In-order**: Visit left ‚Üí root ‚Üí right.\n",
    "  - Example: `[4, 2, 5, 1, 10, 3]`\n",
    "- **Post-order**: Visit left ‚Üí right ‚Üí root.\n",
    "  - Example: `[4, 5, 2, 10, 3, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example Walkthrough (Pre-order):\n",
    "Using the tree:\n",
    "```\n",
    "          1\n",
    "        /   \\\n",
    "       2     3\n",
    "      / \\   / \n",
    "     4   5 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start at the root (`1`).\n",
    "2. Visit left subtree (`2 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5`).\n",
    "3. Visit right subtree (`3 ‚Üí 10`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Breadth-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "BFS uses a **queue** to explore nodes level by level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### BFS Example:\n",
    "For the tree:\n",
    "```\n",
    "          1\n",
    "        /   \\\n",
    "       2     3\n",
    "      / \\   / \n",
    "     4   5 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "BFS traversal: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "- DFS prioritizes depth (go as deep as possible, then backtrack).\n",
    "- BFS prioritizes breadth (visit all nodes at the current level before descending).\n",
    "- DFS is stack-based, while BFS uses a queue.\n",
    "- A tree‚Äôs height is its maximum depth, and it determines traversal time complexity.\n",
