    "\n",
    "A **heap** is also a binary tree, but it follows **different rules**:\n",
    "- It's usually represented as a **complete binary tree** (all levels are filled left-to-right, except possibly the last).\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Two Types of Heaps:**\n",
    "- **Max-Heap**: The parent node is **always greater** than its children. (The biggest number sits at the top.)\n",
    "- **Min-Heap**: The parent node is **always smaller** than its children. (The smallest number sits at the top.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of Max-Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "     2. **Delete/Extract**: Remove the root element (min or max) and restore the heap property.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3. **Write the Key Functions**\n",
    "Hereâ€™s a roadmap for writing heap operations in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### a) **Heapify**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def heapify(arr, n, i):\n",
    "    largest = i  # Initialize largest as root (for max-heap)\n",
    "    left = 2 * i + 1\n",

    "### 4. **Practice Common Problems**\n",
    "   - **Heap Construction**: Build a min-heap or max-heap from an array.\n",
    "   - **Kth Largest/Smallest Element**: Use a heap to find the Kth largest or smallest number in an array.\n",
    "   - **Merge K Sorted Arrays**: Use a min-heap to merge arrays efficiently.\n",
    "   - **Top K Elements**: Use a max-heap or min-heap to find the top K frequent elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Visualize the Process**\n",
    "   - Draw the tree representation of the heap and the corresponding array during each step of insertion, deletion, or heapify. This will help solidify your understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Test Your Knowledge**\n",
    "   - Once you understand the basics, practice implementing a heap without looking at notes.\n",
    "   - Solve LeetCode or HackerRank problems that involve heaps (look for problems tagged with \"heap\" or \"priority queue\").\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 7. **Build Confidence**\n",
    "   - During interviews, be ready to explain how you implemented the heap operations and why they work.\n",

    "Pythonâ€™s `heapq` is a **min-heap** by default, meaning the smallest element is always at the root (index 0). If you need a max-heap, you can simulate it using negated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common `heapq` Functions:\n",
    "1. **`heapify(iterable)`**:\n",
    "   - Turns a list into a valid heap in O(n) time.\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     import heapq\n",
    "     nums = [3, 2, 1, 5, 6, 4]\n",
    "     heapq.heapify(nums)  # Converts to a min-heap\n",
    "     print(nums)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 4]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`heappush(heap, element)`**:\n",
    "   - Adds an element to the heap while maintaining the heap property.\n",

    "     ```python\n",

    "3. **`heappop(heap)`**:\n",
    "   - Removes and returns the smallest element (root) from the heap.\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     smallest = heapq.heappop(nums)\n",

    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`heappushpop(heap, element)`**:\n",
    "   - Pushes a new element onto the heap, then pops and returns the smallest element in one step (more efficient than separate push and pop operations).\n",
    "   - Example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = heapq.heappushpop(nums, 8)\n",
    "     print(result)  # Output: 1 (smallest element popped)\n",
    "     print(nums)  # Output: [2, 5, 3, 8, 6, 4]\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`heapreplace(heap, element)`**:\n",
    "   - Pops and returns the smallest element, then pushes a new element onto the heap in one step.\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     result = heapq.heapreplace(nums, 10)\n",

    "     ```\n",

    "6. **`nlargest(n, iterable)` and `nsmallest(n, iterable)`**:\n",

    "     print(heapq.nlargest(3, nums))  # Output: [10, 8, 6]\n",

    "If visualizing the tree more than a height of 2 is tough, hereâ€™s what you can do:\n",
    "1. **Draw It Out**: When working with a heap, draw both the tree and its array representation. Label the indexes!\n",
    "2. **Think in Layers**: The heap builds level by level:\n",
    "   - Layer 1: Root (index 0)\n",
    "   - Layer 2: Two children (indexes 1 and 2)\n",
    "   - Layer 3: Four children (indexes 3, 4, 5, 6)\n",
    "3. **Focus on Patterns**:\n",
    "   - Left child of `i`: Always at `2 * i + 1`.\n",
    "   - Right child of `i`: Always at `2 * i + 2`.\n",
    "   - Parent of `i`: Always at `(i - 1) // 2`.\n",
