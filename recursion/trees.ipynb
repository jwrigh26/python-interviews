    "# Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are hierarchical data structures. Data can be organized in levels that represent different degrees of importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In whiteboard problems, trees oftern consist of numbers for simplicity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of a Tree\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  2   3\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `1` is the **root** (the topmost node).\n",
    "- `2` and `3` are its children: `root.left` and `root.right`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Node Representation in Code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.left = None\n",
    "        self.right = None\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "root = TreeNode(1)\n",
    "root.left = TreeNode(2)\n",
    "root.right = TreeNode(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trees are Family\n",
    "Trees can be viewed like a family tree that was turned upside down:  \n",
    "- The **root** is like the grandpa.  \n",
    "- Each **node** can have \"children\" or connecting nodes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to think about trees is as directed graphs with specific rules (i.e., they have rules like no cycles and may include weights, like a heap).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parts\n",
    "- **Root**: The topmost node.  \n",
    "- **Parent/Child**: A parent points to one or more children.  \n",
    "- **Leaf**: A node with no children.  \n",
    "- **Depth**: How far \"down\" a node is.  \n",
    "- **Height**: How \"tall\" the tree is from a specific node.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Types\n",
    "- [Binary Tree](./bts.ipynb)  \n",
    "- [Binary Search Tree (BST)](./bsts.ipynb)  \n",
    "- [Heaps](./heaps.ipynb)  \n",
    "- N-ary Tree  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Traversals\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary types:\n",
    "1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Explores as far down one branch as possible before backtracking.\n",
    "2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to the next level.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Depth-First Search (DFS)\n",
    "DFS uses a **stack** (or recursion) to prioritize depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### DFS Traversal Orders\n",
    "- **Pre-order**: Visit the root → left → right.\n",
    "- **In-order**: Visit left → root → right.\n",
    "- **Post-order**: Visit left → right → root.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example Walkthrough (Pre-order):\n",
    "```\n",
    "          1\n",
    "        /   \\\n",
    "       2     3\n",
    "      / \\   / \n",
    "     4   5 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start at the root (`1`).\n",
    "2. Visit left subtree (`2 → 4 → 5`).\n",
    "3. Visit right subtree (`3 → 10`).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of Output for Traversal Orders\n",
    "- **Pre-order**:  `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3, 10]`\n",
    "- **In-order**:   `[4, 2, 5, 1, 10, 3]`\n",
    "- **Post-order**: `[4, 5, 2, 10, 3, 1]`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bread-First Search (BFS)\n",
    "BFS uses a queue to explore nodes level by level, moving from left to right at each level before descending.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's order is left to right for all items on the same level.\n",
    "##### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "```\n",
    "          1\n",
    "        /   \\\n",
    "       2     3\n",
    "      / \\   / \n",
    "     4   5 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Start at the root (1) and enqueue it.\n",
    "2. Dequeue the first node (1) and visit it. Enqueue its children (2 and 3).\n",
    "3. Dequeue the next node (2) and visit it. Enqueue its children (4 and 5).\n",
    "4. Dequeue the next node (3) and visit it. Enqueue its child (10).\n",
    "5. Dequeue the next node (4) and visit it. (No children to enqueue.)\n",
    "6. Dequeue the next node (5) and visit it. (No children to enqueue.)\n",
    "7. Dequeue the next node (10) and visit it. (No children to enqueue.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of Output\n",
    "BFS traversal: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "- DFS prioritizes depth (go as deep as possible, then backtrack).\n",
    "- BFS prioritizes breadth (visit all nodes at the current level before descending).\n",
    "- DFS is stack-based, while BFS uses a queue.\n",
    "- A tree’s height is its maximum depth, and it determines traversal time complexity.\n",
