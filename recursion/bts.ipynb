    "# Binary Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A **binary tree** is a type of tree where each node has **at most two children**. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Binary trees are commonly used for **traversal**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example of a Binary Tree\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  2   3\n",
    " / \\\n",
    "4   5\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `1` is the **root** (the topmost node).\n",
    "- `2` and `3` are its children: `root.left` and `root.right`.\n",
    "- `4` and `5` are leaf nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Tree Node Representation in Code\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TreeNode:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, value):\n",
    "        self.value = value\n",
    "        self.left = None\n",
    "        self.right = None\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example usage:\n",
    "root = TreeNode(1)\n",
    "root.left = TreeNode(2)\n",
    "root.right = TreeNode(3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "- **Root Node**: The topmost node in the tree. In the example, `1` is the root.  \n",
    "- **Leaf Nodes**: Nodes with no children (both `left` and `right` are `None`).  \n",
    "- **Parent Node**: The node directly above a given node. For example, `1` is the parent of `2` and `3`.  \n",
    "- **Subtree**: Any node and its descendants can be considered a subtree. For instance, node `2` forms a subtree with `4` and `5`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Trees are Graphs\n",
    "- Binary trees are a subset of **directed graphs**.  \n",
    "- Typically, you cannot traverse \"up\" the tree because nodes don't have a `parent` reference.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Binary Trees\n",
    "- **Complete Binary Trees**  \n",
    "- **Perfect Binary Trees**  \n",
    "- **Binary Trees as Arrays**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Complete Binary Tree\n",
    "A tree where all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of a Complete Binary Tree:\n",
    "```\n",
    "          1\n",
    "        /   \\\n",
    "       2     3\n",
    "      / \\   / \n",
    "     4   5 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Node `3` has no right child, but the tree is still considered **complete**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Perfect Binary Tree\n",
    "A tree where all levels are fully filled, and all leaf nodes are at the same depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of a Perfect Binary Tree:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    1\n",
    "   / \\\n",
    "  2   3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Binary Trees as Arrays\n",
    "Binary trees can also be represented as arrays. For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The array indices represent:\n",
    "- `i`: Current node.\n",
    "- `2*i + 1`: Left child.\n",
    "- `2*i + 2`: Right child.\n",
