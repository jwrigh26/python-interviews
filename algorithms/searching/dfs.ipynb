    "### Why Use Depth-First Search (DFS)?\n",
    "DFS is a powerful algorithm for exploring all possible paths in a tree or graph structure. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to:\n",
    "1. **Explore All Possibilities**: DFS traverses as far as possible along one branch before backtracking, making it suitable for exploring all combinations or paths (e.g., solving mazes, puzzles).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Backtracking**: DFS naturally incorporates backtracking, where you can \"undo\" a step and try a different path, making it ideal for problems like Word Search or generating permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connectivity and Component Detection**: DFS helps in finding connected components in a graph, such as counting islands in a grid (Number of Islands problem).\n"
